wt-classes, utility classes used by Wt applications
------------------------------------------

(Optional) to configure the library, use configure.py

Compile and install wt-classes library:
$ cmake .
$ make install
Read about cmake for more information

Dependencies:
 * cmake >= 2.6
 * libboost >= 1.42 (libboost-system, libboost-filesystem, libboost-thread)
 * witty library (>=3.1.2)
 * openssl library (for md5)
 * python, containing argparse module (used by Makefile and locales-test)

Build-only dependencies:
 * rst2man (used to build manpage)
 * wget to get jquery.countdown.js (already included in a distribution tar file)
 * doxygen to build documentation

Recommendations:
 * YUI library >= 2.8.0 for SWFStore

To exclude openssl dependency, apply script no-openssl.sh

To build wt-classes against Wt 3.1.10, before build
apply script for-wt-3.1.10.sh

To build wt-classes against Wt 3.1.2, before build
apply script for-wt-3.1.2.sh

To install locales-test:
# easy_install locales-test
 or
# pip install locales-test

To get debian packages, run ``debuild''.

For Ubuntu, you can get the packages, lacking some classes or features (in order
to be compatible with outdated Wt versions from Ubuntu distributions):
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:starius/wc
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install '.*wtclasses.*'
