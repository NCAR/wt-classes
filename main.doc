<h3>locales</h3>

\note wt-classes does not load its l10n xml files by itself.
This should be done from an application.

The path to these files is like /usr/share/Wt/Wc/locales/wtclasses.xml.

For wt-classes examples: be sure to <b>set approot to /usr/share/Wt/Wc/</b>.

If you are developing an application, using wt-classes,
it is up to you how to manage this situation.
You can create a symlink to Wc/locales from your own locales/ directory.
Do not copy or link wtclasses.xml file, since names of files for other languages
would duffer from wtclasses.xml.

<h3>resources</h3>

All resources of wt-classes are located under resources/Wc/ directory.
If you get Wt resources working, resources of wt-classes are likely
to work too.

For wt-classes examples: be sure to <b>set docroot to /usr/share/Wt/</b>.

See special note about resources for SWFStore.
